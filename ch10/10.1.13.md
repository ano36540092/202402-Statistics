- Normal Probability Plot
  -  Vertical axis: Quantile (percentile). Can be matched to the $`\bar{X} \pm a \sigma`$.
  -  Horizontal axis: The values of data （$` X_i,\ i=1,…,15;\ X_1～X_{15} `$）.
  -  There are 15 data.
- Rearrange the raw data by the number size and then calculate the position of each point among these 15 data.
  - We can use any of the formulas: $` \dfrac{i}{n+1}`$ or $` \dfrac{i-0.5}{n}`$ ($`n`$: sample size). 
-  Find the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data and standard normal distribution, then we can get the straight line.
   - Straight line means the data is normal.
   - If there is any deviation from straight line, that means the data is not normal.
-  In this case, we can see every point is nearly fitted on the straight line, so it shows the data $`{\color{red}comes\ from\ a\ normal\ distribution}`$ .
